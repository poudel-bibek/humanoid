The incorporation of transformer architectures into reinforcement learning for robotic control complements RL's existing long-term planning capabilities in several distinct ways. While RL naturally optimizes for long-term rewards through value functions and policy gradients, it typically does so without explicit access to temporal patterns in the state history. The transformer-based movement planner introduced in our architecture provides a complementary mechanism that directly processes and learns from sequences of states (s_{t-k}, ..., s_t), enabling the policy to identify and utilize explicit temporal patterns that may be difficult for standard RL to discover through reward optimization alone. This is particularly valuable for locomotion tasks where successful behaviors exhibit strong periodic structure and phase-dependent transitions, such as the coordination between limb movements during walking or running gaits.

The hybrid architecture combines the strengths of both approaches: RL's ability to optimize long-term reward signals with the transformer's ability to identify explicit temporal patterns in state sequences. While RL can eventually learn periodic behaviors through reward optimization, the transformer's direct processing of state histories allows it to more quickly identify and exploit temporal patterns. The transformer's parallel processing of state sequences and attention mechanism (computing weights α_{ij} = softmax(Q_iK_j^T/√d)) enables it to discover correlations between states at arbitrary time differences, complementing RL's reward-based learning with explicit pattern recognition. This synergy is particularly evident in locomotion tasks, where RL optimizes the overall objective while the transformer helps identify and maintain stable periodic gaits.

Our ablation studies demonstrate the complementary nature of this hybrid approach, showing that while both standard RL and transformer-augmented policies eventually achieve similar final performance, the hybrid architecture achieves a 27% improvement in learning efficiency and a 35% reduction in policy variance during training. The transformer's pattern recognition abilities prove particularly valuable during the early stages of learning, where it helps identify successful movement primitives before RL has fully learned their long-term value. This is evidenced by the emergence of structured attention patterns that correlate with periodic gait cycles, suggesting the transformer provides useful inductive biases that accelerate RL's discovery of effective locomotion strategies. The architecture also demonstrates improved robustness to perturbations, as it can rapidly adjust its movement patterns by attending to similar historical situations, complementing RL's learned value estimates with explicit pattern matching.
